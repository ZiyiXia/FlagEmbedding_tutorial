# Text Retrieval

Text retrieval is a natural language task that retrieves the most relevant information based on the input queries. Being one of the core component of information retrieval, text retrieval has many important downstream use cases such as: web search, keyword/sentence search, question answering, dialog system, etc.

In this module, we'll walk through the key components of text retrieval by covering their basic concepts and applications.

## [Quick Start](./quick_start.ipynb)

In quick start, we provide a very simple example including embedding, computing similarity, ranking, and evaluation.

## Embedding

## [Similarity](./similarity.ipynb)

In this part, we show several popular similarity functions and examples of their usage.

## [Indexing](./Indexing.ipynb)

Indexing is not included in the quick start, but it's a very important part in practical cases. This part shows how to use [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) to create your first index for embeddings.

## Evaluation
